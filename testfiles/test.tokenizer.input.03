;Question 1
;These three lines of code each get the symbol 'mary from the given list
(car (cdr (cdr ("jane" elizabeth mary kitty lydia))))

;Question 2
;This function takes in an integer (n) and a list (lst) and returns the first n elements of lst
(define keep-first-n
  (lambda (n lst)
    (cond
      ;The list is returned when it has the number of items specified
      ;The entire list is returned if the number of items desired is bigger than the list
      ((<= (length lst) n) lst)
      ;An empty list is returned if the user inputs a negative number.
      ((< n 0) ())
      ;The recursive call takes in a list that does not have the last item
      (else (keep-first-n n (reverse (cdr (reverse lst))))))))
